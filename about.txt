About:
mutliprocessing.py  is the main file that runs the final.py script on all the cores of the machine and then merge the result obtained in form of csv file to a single csv file.

It uses threading library in python which creates threads for each of the task(here the task is to run the final.py script). 
commands:
 t = threading.Thread(target=executeModel , args=(cmd,))
#this creates a thread for task executeModel

t.start()
#starts the thread

Final.py contains the whole logic of the program
It can be broadliy divided into following steps
1.open the csv file to be written 
2.calculate the targets i.e rmsd ,tm_score,gdt_score using native.pdb and model.pdb file
3.Now calculate the features of the model.pdb file using functions defined in pydpi library
4.write all the features in the csv file

*the end*
